# Favorite Places 🗺️❣️
App that I developed using React Native to save my favorite places. In this application, I can save information about my favorite places taking pictures, and selecting their location on the map. This information is stored in a SQL database to permit me to restart my app and don’t lose my saved places.

Features:

- React Native
- Expo
- TypeScript
- Styled Components
- SQLite
